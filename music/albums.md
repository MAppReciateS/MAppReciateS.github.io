Adele Laurie Blue Adkins (born 5 May 1988 in Enfield, North London), known professionally as Adele, is a British singer. Adele has described her musical style as "heartbroken soul". She is the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics' Choice, which was given to artists who, at the time, had yet to release an album. She has noted American jazz and blues singers Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald as influences. She debuted at number one with her Mercury Prize-nominated debut album (19) on the UK album chart; the disc has since been certified platinum with sales of more than 500,000 copies. After the album peaked at #54 on the Billboard 200 chart on 8 July, 2008 (though it did reach #36 on the magazine's "Top Heatseekers" chart). Adele performed before an estimated audience of 14 million television viewers on Saturday Night Live, leading to a very strong showing on a couple of notable download charts, and leading the album to leap from #46 to #11 on the official chart.

## After Hours-The Weeknd

More than most, the phases of R&B-pop auteur [The Weeknd](https://variety.com/t/the-weeknd/) are tightly defined. The three pioneering 2011 mixtapes that launched not only his career but a whole new strain of R&B bled into his more-elaborate but just as dark major-label debut, “Kiss Land.” During that time he was reclusive, declining interviews, rarely being photographed and putting forth a profile as murky as the production on those albums. But 2015’s “Beauty Behind the Madness” was an abrupt and ambitious pivot into big leagues that saw him teaming up with Max Martin, who, with hits ranging from the Backstreet Boys to Taylor Swift, is the most successful producer-songwriter of the past 25 years. That album spawned several massive singles (including “I Can’t Feel My Face” and “In the Night”), featured collaborations with Ed Sheeran and Lana Del Rey, and turned The Weeknd — aka Abel Tesfaye — into a superstar. He got even hotter with the equally massive “Starboy,” released just a year later and highlighted by collaborations with Daft Punk, Kendrick Lamar and Future, which was followed with a “hiatus” that, for this hyper-prolific artist, entailed two tours and a comparatively low-key EP, 2018’s “My Dear Melancholy.”

## Norman F**king Rockwell-Lana Del Rey

Lana Del Rey has always been a pop classicist at heart — but she’s finally made her pop classic. The long-awaited *Norman Fucking Rockwell* is even more massive and majestic than everyone hoped it would be. Lana turns her fifth and finest album into a tour of sordid American dreams, going deep cover in all our nation’s most twisted fantasies of glamour and danger. No other songwriter around does such an expert job of building up elaborate romantic fantasies, and then burning them to the ground. She purrs lines like, “If I wasn’t so fucked up, I’d fuck you all the time,” or, “I heard the war is over if you choose,” or, “Your poetry’s bad and you blame the news.” But the fact that they’re lethally funny doesn’t make them any less chilling.

The songs on *Norman Fucking Rockwell* evoke Margot Robbie’s vision of Sharon Tate in *Once Upon A Time In Hollywood* — still a small-time starlet, requesting VIP treatment at the Bruin Westwood theater in L.A., asking to get in free because she’s in the movie. It could have been a mortifying moment of humiliation, but she’s so guileless in her own stardom fantasy, nobody would dream of charging her the 75 cent admission. In some of these songs, Lana evokes what would have happened if this Sharon Tate wore out her old Paul Revere and the Raiders records and made it into the Seventies milieu of Malibu singer-songwriter torpor.
